bbs - a simple implementation of the Blum, Blum, and Shub random
      number generation algorithm as described in Bruce Schneier's
      book Applied Cryptography 2nd Ed (1996)

From the book:
    Find two large prime numbers, (p) and (q), which are congruent to
    3 modulo 4.  The product of these numbers, (n), is a blum integer.
    Choose another random integer, (x), which is relatively prime to
    (n).  Compute x[0] = (x^2) % n.  x[0] is the seed for the generator.
    now we can start computing bits.  The (i)th pseudo-random bit is the
    least significant bit of x[i] = (x[i-1] ^ 2) % n.

    The security of this scheme rests on the difficulty of factoring
    (n).  You can make (n) public so that anyone can generate bits.
    However, unless a cryptanalyst can factor (n), he can never predict
    the output of the generator - not even with a statement like:
    "the next bit has a 51 percent change of being a 1".
